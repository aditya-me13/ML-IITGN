## Overview

Machine Learning Assignment on K-Nearest Neighbours Algorithm (Naive) and its comparision with Approximate KNN algorithms like
- **Locality Sensetive Hashing (LSH)**
- **K Dimensional Trees (KDT)**
  
for space and time complexity analysis

## Excat Problem Statement

In this question you will implement and compare the following different KNN variants (we will discuss the a) and b) part of this in the upcoming tutorial)
LSH (1.5 marks)
KD-tree (1.5 marks)
Naive version of KNN (0.5 marks)

Vary dataset size $N$, number of dimensions $D$ to do training and testing time and memory comparison for finding $K$ nearest neighbours. (1 mark)
Now, in a 2d randomly generated dataset visually show how many of the $K$ closest neighbours appx. $K$ NN methods miss out due to their approximate nature. 
Also show the partitions in the 2d space. (0.5 marks)
